//  A local zoo wants to keep track of how many pounds of food each of its three monkeys
//  eats each day during a typical week. Write a program that stores this information in a
//  two-dimensional 3x5 array, where each row represents a different monkey, and each
//  column represents a different day of the week. The program should first have the user
//  input the data for each monkey. Then, it should create a report that includes the following
//  information:
//
//  * Average amount of food eaten per day by the whole family of monkeys
//  * The least amount of food eaten during the week by any one monkey
//  * The greatest amount of food eaten during the week by any one monkey
//
//  Input Validation: Do not accept negative numbers for pounds of food eaten.
